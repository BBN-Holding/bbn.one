        <h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
        <h3><span><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>BBN Holding and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “BBN”) are responsible for this website, including its mobile versions, and we are committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to both. BBN has implemented technical, administrative and physical measures to safeguard any personal information that we may collect.</span></p>
        <p><span>This Privacy Notice describes our practices related to personal information collected through BBN websites and mobile versions, unless there is a separate privacy notice for the website or mobile version.</span></p>
        <h3><span><strong>Does this Notice apply to all BBN Websites?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>This Privacy Notice applies to visitors of BBN websites that link to this Privacy Notice. Individual websites for BBN entities, services and products may adopt different privacy notices because the transactions taking place on those websites may be different. If an BBN website has its own privacy notice, the provisions of that notice apply to that website.</span></p>
        <h3><span><strong>What personal information does BBN collect?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>BBN monitors user traffic patterns throughout the website according to a user’s domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and pages viewed. This information is collected in order to measure the number of visitors to our website and to determine which areas users find useful based upon the traffic to particular areas. BBN uses this information to enhance visitors’ experience and to better prepare future content based on the interests of visitors.</span></p>
        <p><span>A visitor to our website may be asked to provide personal information to receive a response or some other service from BBN. The personal information that you may be requested to provide includes your name, email address and any information that you choose to provide. The collection of information will be transparent to you – you will be asked for it and will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to provide it. If you choose not to provide any of the personal information requested, BBN may be unable to complete the transaction you have requested.</span></p>
        <p><span>Your mobile provider may have a conflicting privacy position that captures personal information when you visit our website, but BBN is not responsible for and does not control how other parties may collect your information when you access our website(s).</span></p>
        <h3><span><strong>How does BBN use the personal information it collects?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>Any personal information collected will only be used to:</span></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>conduct basic business operations, such as communicate with customers and business planning;</li>
            <li>provide investor services;</li>
            <li>provide the information, item or service you have requested;</li>
            <li>communicate with you about products, services and events relating to BBN;</li>
            <li>improve our products, services and websites;</li>

        <h3><span><strong>Where does BBN store your information?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>Because BBN is a global company with locations in many different countries, we may transfer your information from one legal entity to another or from one country to another in order to accomplish the purposes listed above.

We will transfer your personal information consistent with applicable legal requirements and only to the extent necessary for the purposes set forth above.</span></p>
        <p><span>BBN relies on available legal mechanisms to enable the legal transfer of personal information across borders. To the extent that BBN relies on the standard contractual clauses (also called the model clauses) or Binding Corporate Rules to authorize transfer, BBN will comply with those requirements, including where there may be a conflict between those requirements and this Notice.</span></p>

        <h3><span><strong>How long does BBN retain personal information?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>BBN will retain personal information as long as needed to comply with its contractual and legal obligations.

        <h3><span><strong>How does BBN use cookies or other tracking technologies?</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span>BBN uses cookies on this website.

Cookies do not damage users’ computers or files. If you do not want cookies to be accessible by this or any other BBN website, you should adjust the settings on your browser program to deny or disable the use of cookies.
